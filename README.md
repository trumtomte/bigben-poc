# BigBen (PoC)

A simple proof-of-concept bittorrent client in Elixir, to both learn a new
language (somewhat) and to get a better understanding of bencoded data (i.e.
torrent files) and how the bittorrent protocol works.

Everything has only been run via the REPL so far.

Supports downloading from a torrent file or magnet URI.
